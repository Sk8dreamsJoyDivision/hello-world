Hi 
My name is Alan. I love Joy Division, The Smiths and Morrissey
and also skateboarding, Dostoyevsky and Electronics. 
I'm an electronic engineer, I like programming and build electronic circuits.
I'm from MÃ©xico and yes the mexican food is my favourite food, but i don't call it
mexican food, just food... Wait a minute, actually we do! We have particular dishes 
that we call mexican food.
